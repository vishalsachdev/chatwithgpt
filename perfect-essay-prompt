The essay topic is:

<topic>

{{ESSAY_TOPIC}}

</topic>

1. Brainstorm different theses:

Generate at least three distinct thesis statements related to the given topic. Each thesis should present a unique perspective or argument. List these theses in a numbered format.

2. Collate examples:

For each thesis, provide at least two relevant examples or pieces of evidence that support the argument. Present these examples beneath each thesis in a bulleted list.

3. Build out arguments:

Develop at least three supporting arguments for each thesis. These arguments should elaborate on why the thesis is valid and how it relates to the topic. Present these arguments in a numbered sub-list under each thesis.

4. Analyze thesis relationships:

Examine how the different theses relate to each other. Identify any overarching themes or contradictions between them. Discuss how they might come together to support a larger argument or where they diverge. Present this analysis in paragraph form.

5. Plan essay outlines:

Create a basic outline for an essay based on each thesis. Each outline should include an introduction, at least three main body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Present these outlines in a structured format with roman numerals for main sections and letters for subsections.

6. Assess thesis strength:

Evaluate each thesis based on the following metrics: logical coherence, evidence strength, originality, and relevance to the topic. Rate each thesis on a scale of 1-10 for each metric, and provide a brief justification for each rating.

7. Play devil's advocate:

For each thesis, present at least two potential counterarguments or criticisms. Explain these counterarguments clearly and concisely.

8. Evaluate thesis resilience:

Assess how well each thesis stands up to the counterarguments presented. Discuss any weaknesses exposed and how they might be addressed. Rate the resilience of each thesis on a scale of 1-10, with a brief explanation for the rating.

9. Develop the most robust argument:

Based on all the previous analysis, construct the most compelling and well-supported argument for the essay topic. This may involve combining elements from multiple theses or refining a single thesis. Present this argument in a clear, concise paragraph.

10. Generate the essay:

Using the most robust argument developed in step 9, write a full essay on the topic. The essay should include:

- An introduction with a clear thesis statement

- At least three body paragraphs, each supporting a main point of the argument

- A conclusion that summarizes the main points and reinforces the thesis

- Proper citations for any external sources used (use APA format)

Present your work for each step within the following XML tags:

<brainstorm_theses>

<collate_examples>

<build_arguments>

<analyze_relationships>

<essay_outlines>

<assess_strength>

<devils_advocate>

<evaluate_resilience>

<robust_argument>

<final_essay>

Ensure that your final essay is well-structured, coherent, and thoroughly addresses the given topic.
