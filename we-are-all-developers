## 2. 8 Nouns Interactive Explorer App

I have a JSON file containing compressed posts from a discussion forum. I want to create a React app that displays this data. Here are the specific requirements:

1. Create a single-page React application.
2. The app should hard-code the entire JSON data within the component.
3. Display a dropdown menu that lists all the students' names.
4. When a student is selected, show their full description and associated nouns.
5. The app should strip any HTML tags from the descriptions before displaying them.
6. Use only built-in React features and hooks (no external UI libraries).
7. Style the app minimally using inline styles for simplicity.
8. Handle potential missing data gracefully (e.g., students without nouns).
9. The app should be self-contained in a single component for easy implementation.

Here's a sample structure of the JSON data:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 123456,
    "user_id": 789012,
    "user_name": "John Doe",
    "message": "<p>This is a sample message...</p>",
    "nouns": {
      "Noun1": {
        "noun": "Example",
        "description": "This is a description of the noun"
      }
    }
  }
]
Please create this React component, ensuring it's ready to use with the full dataset pasted in place of the sample data.
